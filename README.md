## Hi there 👋 My name is Swizel
🚀 Data Science Masters Graduate | Python, .NET, SQL, Machine Learning & AI | Power BI | Tableau | DAX | RPA Enthusiast

# 🙋‍♂️ About me
I’m a Data Science Masters graduate with a passion for uncovering insights and building impactful solutions. My technical toolkit includes Python, .NET, SQL, and I thrive in the world of machine learning, AI, and automation. I love bringing data to life with Power BI and Tableau, and DAX is my secret weapon for next-level analytics. RPA? Absolutely I’m all about making workflows smarter and faster.
</br>
But I’m not all code and dashboards! When I’m not wrangling data, you’ll find me at the gym, hitting the running trails, or flexing my creative muscles through drawing and crafting or spending time with my beautiful pets Spotty, Kelly, and Snowy.. I believe fitness fuels the mind, and creativity sparks innovation whether I’m designing a new report or sketching in my free time.
</br>
Check out my pinned repos for a taste of my work, and let’s connect on LinkedIn! Always excited to collaborate and explore new adventures in data, tech, and creativity.
</br>
Let’s lift, run, build, and create—together! 💡🏋️‍♂️🎨
