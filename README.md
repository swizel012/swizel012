## Hi there 👋 My name is Swizel

# 🙋‍♂️ About me
I'm an MSc Data Scientist interested in all things Python & AI!

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a website for a Guest House for tourists bookings and tourism analytics
- 🌱 I’m currently learning German
- 👯 I recently built a tourism recommendation site, recommending motivations to tourists based on demographics and events.
</br>
When I'm not analyzing patterns, training models and building dreams, I can be found lifting weights 🏋️ and spending time with my beautiful pets — Spotty, Kelly, and Snowy.
